Congratulations on deciding to become a dog owner! Owning a dog is a wonderful, rewarding experience. Dogs make great companions, they're fun, and if you pick a large dog, they can be great body pillows. 

The first step to becoming a dog owner, of course, is to pick your dog! But there are multiple breeds to choose from. How do you know which breed is best for you? Keep reading to find out what you should consider when picking your first dog.

## Lifestyle

What kind of lifestyle do you lead? Do you work multiple jobs? Are you often on the go? 

Some breeds, like the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Golden Retrievers, and Border Collie, are companion animals at heart. In other words, they can develop separation anxiety. If you're usually on the go and rarely at home, you may want to avoid these breeds. Labrador Retrivers, French Bulldogs, and Pugs usually do better when left at home alone. 

## Space

You don't necessarily need a large space to have a large dog. It's more important that you provide opportunities for your dog to get plenty of exercise and participate in enriching activities. However, your living space is still a factor to consider when picking your first dog. If you're rarely at home *and* live in a small space, your Golden Retriever may develop behavioral problems since they're very social breeds. 

Think about the size of your living space and, if it's a small space, think about how you'll make sure your dog gets exercise and social interaction time.

## Personality

Breeds that are known to be laid-back and easygoing are usually good choices for first time dog owners. Although there will always be a learning curve for training a new dog, dogs with a calm temperament may be easier to train. They also may not require constant entertainment. Greyhounds, St. Bernard, and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel are known to be very calm with easygoing personalities.

Breeds like Dalmations, Border Collies, and Australian Shepherd are very energetic dog breeds. They might require constant entertainment or exercise. If you're a very active person, or know that you will be able to match their high-energy needs, consider looking into one of these breeds!

Your lifestyle, space, and personality preferences are important factors to consider when picking a new dog. If you're interested in a particular dog breed, make sure that you do plenty of research to learn more about their energy requirements, size requirements, and their personality.
